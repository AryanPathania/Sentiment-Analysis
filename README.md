# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.

### Dataset 

This is the link to the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format).

### Approach !!

- First I have done basic pre processing on the data like tokenization, making embedding, padding etc.
- After that, while defining the model I have used **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** instead of basic RNN to tackle the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients.

### Result !!!

The training loss after 10 epochs is 0.262
